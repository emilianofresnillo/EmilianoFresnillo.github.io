        <p class="BioAnswer">I was born in a border town
             called Laredo in south Texas, but I was raised
             on the other side of the river in Nuevo Laredo,
             Mexico. In my house resided my mom, dad, brother,
             and my two dogs: Mini and Nina. I was raised with
             the Mexican and American culture because during the
             weekends we would cross to Texas to eat or run 
             some errands. When I got to high school, I 
             transfered to a school in Texas while I was still
             living in Mexico so i had to cross veryday to get 
             to school. During that time, my borther attended 
             Texas A&M University (Class 2017). I visted him 
             sometimes and I really iked the college. As a 
             result of liking the school, I am here taking VIST 474.</p>

            <p class="QuoteInfo">“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. 
                Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond 
                measure. It is our light, not our darkness, 
                that most frightens us. ... And as we let our 
                own lights shine, we unconsciously give other 
                people permission to do the same. As we are 
                liberated from our own fear, our presence 
                automatically liberates others.”</p>
